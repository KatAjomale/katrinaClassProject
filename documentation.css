/*Documentation - what i need to write about:
 - how i did the CSS/LESS file
 - adding the modernizr, jquery, and plugin files to the website structure
 - adding the Magnific popup plugin to the abouts page
 - need to add the Cycle2 plugin to the homepage and get it to work i.e. not covering the header and navigation
 - adding a Google map to the contact page.
 - reason for changing the table in contact page to be done with embedded stylesheet and <labels> rather than using a table
 - work out how to get the logo to float next to the header
